# ThinSat_GNSS-R_Rogue_Wave_Surveyor
(In development...)

Adrucam Lib From: https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arduino.git

For years, rogue waves have led to the destruction of ships and industries with its unpredictability. With waves twice the size coming seemingly out of nowhere,
it is difficult to predict with current technology how and why they occur. There are theories and some developed technologies for understanding these waves, 
but they still are not justified in predicting and truly identifying them. The ThinSat GRWS will utilize image processing and the GNSS-R (Used in Oceanography)
to find the horizon of the earthâ€™s surface and determine rouge waves over periods of time. The project will use the Arduino UNO Board and Arducam to capture
images and run the ThinSat. Here in this presentation, the ThinSat was demonstrated on a smaller scale as launch dates are yet to be announced. The resulting 
prototype can be demonstrated utilizing small tests using a motorized tank to replicate waves. With collecting wave data, it can demonstrate the ThinSat
capabilities to aid in our understanding of this phenomenon, leading to implementing possible solutions to combat these dangerous waves. Going forward,
the ThinSat will continue further development to later be launched from NASA Wallops Flight Facility.
